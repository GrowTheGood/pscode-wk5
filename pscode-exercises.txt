// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Declare two variables 'num1' and 'num2', input the value of 'num1', input the value of 'num2', calculate the sum of 'num1' and 'num2' and store in in a variable called 'sum', display the value of 'sum')

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Declare a variable 'num' to store the input number, input the value of 'num', check if 'num' modulo 2 is equal to 0, if condition is true display "num is even" to indicate that the number is even, if the condition is false display "num is odd" to indicate that the number is odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Declare variables num1, num2, num3, num4, num5 to store the five numbers, as well as total, average, minimum, and maximum to store the calculated results, input the value of 'num1', input the value of 'num2', input the value of 'num3', input the value of 'num4', input the value of 'num5', calculate the 'total' by adding 'num1', 'num2', 'num3', 'num4', and 'num5', calculate the 'average' by dividing 'total' by 5, find the 'minimum' among the five numbers, find the 'maximum' among the five numbers, display the the average with a message describing what they are, display the minimum and maximum with a message describing what they are)
